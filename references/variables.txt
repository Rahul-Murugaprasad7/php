The main superglobal variables in PHP include:

$_GET: Contains data sent to the script via HTTP GET method. It retrieves variables from the query string in the URL.

$_POST: Holds data sent to the script via HTTP POST method. It's commonly used for form submissions.

$_REQUEST: A combined array that merges $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE arrays. 
It's not recommended to rely on $_REQUEST as it can be less predictable due to its combined nature.

$_SESSION: Stores session variables that persist across multiple pages. It allows you to store and retrieve session-specific data.

$_COOKIE: Contains values transmitted in HTTP cookies. It enables you to retrieve cookies sent to the browser.

$_SERVER: Provides information about server and execution environment, such as headers, paths, and script locations.

$_ENV: Holds environment variables passed to the script's environment.

$_FILES: Contains information about uploaded files via HTTP POST. It's used when handling file uploads.

$GLOBALS: An associative array containing references to all variables which are currently defined in the global scope of the script.

$_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_SESSION, $_SERVER, $_ENV, $_FILES, $GLOBALS, and $_REQUEST are examples of superglobal variables in PHP. 
They are accessible from any part of the script and are widely used for various purposes, such as handling form data, managing sessions, 
accessing server information, and more.
